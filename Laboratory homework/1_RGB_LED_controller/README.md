# RGB LED Controller

## Summary
Small circuit that controls the color of an RGB Led using 3 rotary encoders for input, each controlling a single channel of the LED.

## Components needed:
* RGB Led (mine is common cathode)
* 3 220 Ohm resistors
* 3 Rotary Encoders (potentiometers)
* Jumper cables
* Arduino

## Code 
Code is pretty straight forward. See the .ino file for more details. Basically just connect the encoders as analog inputs and the pins of the led as digital output. Map the values and assign them to the rgb channels of the led.
